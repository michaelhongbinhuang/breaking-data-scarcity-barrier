## Important Notes

This folder contains the .csv files of risk-free rates used for calculating Sharpe ratios. Each .csv file includes two essential columns: date and risk-free rate (named 'RF' in the code), spanning the testing period of the corresponding asset. The risk-free rate data is sourced from the [Kenneth R. French Data Library](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html).
